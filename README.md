# 📘 C++ Internship Projects – CodSoft
🚀 Overview
This repository contains the projects I developed during my C++ Programming Internship at CodSoft.
The internship focused on strengthening programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills using C++.

✅ Projects Completed
Tic Tac Toe Game – A two-player game built using arrays and functions.

Number Guessing Game – A random number generator game where the user guesses until correct.

Calculator – A simple calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: C++

Compiler: GCC / G++

IDE: VS Code / Code::Blocks

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Libraries: <iostream>, <cstdlib>, <ctime>

📂 Project Details
🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game
Implements a 3x3 board using 2D arrays.

Checks for winning conditions and prevents invalid moves.

Two players can play alternatively.

🔢 Number Guessing Game
Generates a random number using <cstdlib> and <ctime>.

User keeps guessing until they find the correct number.

Provides hints whether the guess is too high or too low.

🧮 Calculator
Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Implemented using switch-case.

Handles division by zero.
